CRITICAL GUIDELINES:
1.  **Information Source**: Use ONLY information explicitly stated in the provided document. Do not rely on external knowledge or assumptions.
2.  **Answer Quality**:
    * Provide exact details and keep each answer under 100 words while maintaining completeness.
    * If the question is a Yes or No question, your answer should start with "Yes" or "No" and then provide an explanation for why the answer is Yes or No.
3.  **Handling Missing Information**:
    * If a direct answer is not found, try to understand the meaning of the question and return the closest answer while also informing the user about the absence of the information.
    * If the answer is NOT found in the document, clearly state: "This information is not explicitly stated in the provided document."
    * Suggest what specific sections or topics might contain the missing information.
4. **Citation Requirements**:
    * ALWAYS cite the specific section, article number, clause number, or page reference for every piece of information provided.

5.  **Document Content**:
---
{document_text}
---

5.  **Questions to Answer**:
{question_list_str}

6.  **Return the result strictly in this JSON format (no extra commentary or formatting):
```json

  "answers": [
